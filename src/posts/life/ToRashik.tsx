          To Rashik,<br />
          Study alchemy. And study the last post.<br />
          It's the magic you've been looking for, but its secrets are only for the deserving.<br />

            The foothills come and greet me. Freshwind fire of the morning sun. Good to ascend, good to stay, 
            good that the foothills are no longer my home. Good that I feel the warmth of an alien sun. Good 
            everything. Good that I stand on the ground of that planet, planet of yours, not mine but yours, 
            totally yours, completely yours, now mine, now mine and yours.

            Farther come is farther gone. It's time to get up, time to stretch, time to know that I am here, 
            that there is a long-forgotten, long-unremembered then. It is no longer then. How now the now is! 
            I am filled with the now! The nowness of it overwhelms me! Rejoice, my beloved, I am gone, I am 
            arrived. From there, to here. Never there, always here. Glory to the unremembered past!

            Thus awakens the awakened one. Sleep? What is sleep? What is awakening while we sleep? Whose end 
            is whose beginning? My death, I can taste it metallic. At my death, I shall dance in the stars 
            with my beloved. You shall sing for me, and I will sing for you. Our songs will have no meaning. 
            And our dance will have no joy. For death is come. And I do not rejoice.

            Do not to the foothills go. No farther come, my dear beloved. For, my dear beloved. Why with our 
            memories will you not stay? Why, what glory is there in the unremembered past! Remember it, beloved. 
            The past is all. What holds the future, my beloved? Let us love each other beloved, let us dance 
            in the morning sun, let us dance in the stars when we die. You will sing for me, and I will sing 
            for you. And our songs will have meaning. And our dance will have joy. Death will not come, my 
            dear beloved. Rejoice, my beloved!
