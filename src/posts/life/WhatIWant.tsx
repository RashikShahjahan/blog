        Growing up, I was handed a giant guidebook full of customs, rules, values, and beliefs. 
        However, like many of my peers, I found this guidebook increasingly unhelpful and, at times, 
        even harmful. Thankfully, Uncle Iroh came to the rescue:

        This inspiration led me to look inward. I realized that my life had been optimized for achieving 
        external goalsâ€”not things I genuinely wanted to do, but things I believed I should do. This 
        realization didn't happen overnight; it has been a bumpy journey spanning my teenage years to 
        my late twenties. More recently, I've learned to articulate these ideas more clearly. Here's a 
        list of the things I've discovered I truly want in life:

            1. I don't want to suffer
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Suffering can be both physical and mental. Examples include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
            <li>Injuries</li>
            <li>Health problems</li>
            <li>Emotional stress</li>
            <li>Lack of sleep</li>
            <li>Hunger and thirst</li>
            <li>Poor living conditions</li>
            <li>Living in fear or uncertainty</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            To alleviate suffering, financial stability is crucial. A traditional capitalist mindset can be 
            helpful in securing resources to meet these basic needs.

            2. I want to feel good
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Feeling good includes immediate sources of well-being, such as entertainment, comfort, and pleasure. 
            While money is an important factor, diverse skills and strong social connections also play a 
            significant role in enhancing one's quality of life.

            3. I want to love and be loved
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Being loved means having people who genuinely care about and support me through life's challenges. 
            This support can come from family, friends, and the broader community. To love others means 
            offering that same care and support in return.

            4. I want to be free
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Freedom, for me, is about having control over my life. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
            <li>Freedom of thought and expression</li>
            <li>Access to education and training</li>
            <li>Access to transportation and mobility</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Such freedoms often rely on supportive systems and governance. Unfortunately, those living under 
            poor infrastructure or authoritarian regimes face significant barriers to achieving these freedoms.

            5. I want to accomplish
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Once I am happy and free, I aspire to work toward long-term achievements. These could include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
            <li>Winning a prestigious award</li>
            <li>Holding a position of influence</li>
            <li>Making a discovery</li>

            6. I want to grow
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Once my basic needs are met, I've found fulfillment in thinking beyond myself. By this, I don't 
            mean seeking power or influence to manipulate others for personal gain. Instead, I mean forming 
            meaningful connections and striving to help others in a genuine way.
