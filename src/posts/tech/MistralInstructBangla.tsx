      <p>
        In the arena of large language models like GPT-4, the performance disparity for less-represented 
        languages is stark. Bengali, or 'Bangla', a language spoken by millions, unfortunately, faces a 
        significant lack of digitized, quality text data. To address this, we've embarked on a mission 
        with Mistral-Instruct-Bangla, aiming to enhance Bengali text processing capabilities in AI.
